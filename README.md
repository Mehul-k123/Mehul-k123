## 💼 What I Work On (Professionally)
**Software Developer (Backend) – Kosh Finance**

At Kosh, I work on production-grade systems around **lending, user data, and CRM workflows**, including:

- 💸 **Double-entry accounting ledger system** handling loans, payments, settlements with atomic transactions across multiple balance types and ledger entities.
- 🔐 **Intelligent data update framework** for sensitive user data with multi-field validation, request expiration, and full audit trails.
- 📲 **WhatsApp Cloud API integration** with models like `WhatsAppConfig`, `WAMessage`, `WAWebhook` to send dynamic template-based messages and process webhooks.
- 📊 **Automated CAM (Credit Appraisal Memo) reports** using Python + Excel generation from Django models, reducing manual effort and errors.
- 🗣️ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for internal chat, with hierarchical permissions (Owner, Admin, Moderator, Member).

**DevOps & QA Intern – uSthaan Integrated Solutions**

- 🧱 Refactored a legacy **Electron.js** codebase by replacing the deprecated `remote` module with secure IPC channels for multi-window control, PDF generation, and cross-renderer printing.
- 🧾 Automated **Android APK signing & versioned builds** via shell scripts (cutting release steps from 4 → 1).
- 🔁 Designed **Jenkins CI/CD pipelines** for multi-environment Android builds (Prod & Beta), reducing build errors and manual intervention.

## 🔐 What You *Won’t* See Here

Most of my core, production code lives in **private repositories** on my employers’ GitHub organizations, including work like:

- A **double-entry ledger engine** ensuring atomic, auditable financial flows (loans, payments, settlements).
- A **secure data update system** for sensitive user information with validations, expirations, and audit logs.
- A fully integrated **WhatsApp Cloud API messaging layer** for automated notifications and webhook-driven workflows.
- **Automated CAM report generation** pipelines converting database state into structured Excel reports used by credit teams.
- Refactoring of a **large Electron.js desktop app** for safer IPC communication and long-term maintainability.
- **Jenkins-based CI/CD** for Android, tying together signing, environment-specific builds, and versioning.

If my GitHub looks quieter than my resume, it’s because the interesting stuff is locked behind org permissions. 🙂👉 [Mehul-kosh](https://github.com/Mehulkosh)
